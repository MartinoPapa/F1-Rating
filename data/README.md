Hello there! You've come to my repository about **Formula 1 World Championship**, which is one of the most prestigious motorsport discipline and is spectated by millions of people worldwide on live, TV or online sources.

As a data science enthusiast and have been following F1 for almost two decades, my objective here is to create datasets to enable analyses on drivers and teams with regards to their race results throughout the seasons.

## Source

All these data are obtained from Formula 1 Official [Web Site](https://www.formula1.com/), plus EA & Codemasters F1 Games for driver ratings [here](https://www.ea.com/games/f1/f1-22/driver-ratings/ratings-database?isLocalized=true).

## Featured Datasets

Here are the datasets you can find:
